The project involved the development of an alarm clock complete with an FM radio, auto-dimming display, and inside/outside temperature readings. The alarm clock's components included an ATmega128 microcontroller, ATmega48 microcontroller, AM/FM radio module, 7-segment display, LED bar-graph board, encoders, button board, and an audio amplifier. The micrcontrollers were programmed in C.
