For my senior thesis project at Oregon State University my team designed a system capable of detecting and reading speed signs. It was sponsored by Daimler Trucks North America with the purpose of assisting in their development of autonomous trucks. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a method for reading text from images through pattern matching of individual characters. It is the showcase technology of the project, because it can be used to read a variety of signs. For the project an Android App was developed with Tesseract and OpenCV libraries to do real-time speed sign detection on a Samsung Galaxy S7. After a speed sign was read, the speed value would be output to a Bluetooth LE LCD.

This folder contains the code for the Bluetooth LE LCD portion of the project. An Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE microcontroller was used to interface with the smartphone via Bluetooth LE, and the LCD.
